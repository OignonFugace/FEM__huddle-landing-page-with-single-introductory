## My process
### What I learned
- A little bit about icons, but still a lot to learn. Here I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and their convenient way of loading icons in HTML with CSS classes : [How To Add Icons | Font Awesome Docs](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/add-icons/how-to)


### Continued development
- Read about and practice working and styling icons elements. 


### Questions to community
- Any feedback is welcome. I don't see any particular oversight on my part, but there certainly is!

## Acknowledgments
- Since a couple of days I have been following the foundation curriculum at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). One particular exercice on flexbox helped me find a convenient and suitable way of centering the social media icons in their circles for this Frontend Mentor challenge. I strongly encourage every aspiring web developer like me to go and check what [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) has to offer. This is of great value !
